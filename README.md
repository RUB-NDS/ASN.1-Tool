# Asn1Tool
ASN.1 Tool is an open-source framework for generating arbitrary ASN.1 structures. The tool also provides mechanisms to define modifications of original ASN.1 values. Resulting binary ASN.1 structures can then be used for further processing in other tools.

The tool is not intended to be used directly, but by other software projects as a library.

# Acknowledgements
The framework was initially developed by Nils Kafka (nils.kafka@ruhr-uni-bochum.de) during his master thesis. 

# Projects
This framework is used in future versions of TLS-Attacker (https://github.com/RUB-NDS/TLS-Attacker)
